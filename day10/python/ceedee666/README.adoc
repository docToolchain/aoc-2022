== Day 10

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

Today was straight forward. Just use a list to keep track of the values of x.

=== What did I learn

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_10.py --help`

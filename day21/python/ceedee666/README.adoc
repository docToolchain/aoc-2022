== Day 21

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

Implemented something similar to a binary search. The main idea was to increase the
steps in each iteration and change directions when the sign of the difference between the result and
the expected value changes.


=== What did I learn

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_21.py --help`

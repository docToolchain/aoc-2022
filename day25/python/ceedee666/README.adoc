== Day 24

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution:

* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

=== Main idea

Basically use sets to keep track of the state. I very useful ideas is to move
all positions -1 in x and y direction. This enables much simpler calculations.
The next positions of the blizzards can then, e.g. simply be calculated
using a modulo operation.


=== What did I learn

It is not necessary to create a `list` wen using `max`. The following is possible as
well. This approach creates a generator. Have to read some more details on generators I guess.

[source,python]
----
max_x = max(x for x, _ in walls)

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day_24.py --help`

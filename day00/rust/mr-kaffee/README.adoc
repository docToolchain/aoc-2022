== Day 00: Hello World! ==

It'll be the 3rd year of https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust] solutions for the 2022 edition of 
https://adventofcode.com/2021[Advent of Code]

I created a little solution infrastructure (which resides in the `aoc` subfolder of `day00/rust/mr-kaffee`), that I want to use in my solutions.

My day00 solution can be used to run all or some of the solutions (`cargo run --release \-- run -y 2022 -d 1..=25` or `cargo run --release \-- run -y 2022 -d 1,3,7` or simply `cargo run --release` to run everything)

Other than that, my challenges are again to create solutions that perform well and that do not use external dependencies. The day00 solution is an exception to the latter rule. It uses `itertools`, `clap`, `regex`, and `lazy_static`.

=== General structure ===

My solutions will be implemented in a `src/lib.rs` file and generally have the structure detailed below. This is most probably a bit of an overhead, but fun to write and a learning opportunity for me.


==== The Puzzle definition ====

This is a function returning a `mr_kaffee_aoc::Puzzle` struct which defines metadata, input data, references to solver functions and expected solutions.

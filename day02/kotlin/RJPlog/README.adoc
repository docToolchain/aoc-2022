How does it work: +

Inside function _rockPaperScissors_ the puzzle input is read line by line. With a simple _when_ construct for each game the result is added to a final result.
[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2201_1_2.kts[tags=RPS]

=== Second Star

How does it work: +

The same function call is used only with a different input parameter and therefore a second _when_ construct is taking care for adding up the correct scores of each game.


At the end, both solutions are printed out.
